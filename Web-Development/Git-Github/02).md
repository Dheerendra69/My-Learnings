hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.




Your local branch and the remote branch have diverged.
This means:
* You have commits locally that are not on the remote branch, and
* The remote branch has commits that you don’t have locally.
Because of this, Git cannot decide how to combine the histories when you run git pull. Newer Git versions require you to explicitly choose a strategy instead of assuming one.
What the options mean:
* merge (pull.rebase false) Creates a merge commit that combines local and remote changes.
* rebase (pull.rebase true) Reapplies your local commits on top of the updated remote branch, producing a linear history.
* fast-forward only (pull.ff only) Updates the branch only if no local commits exist; otherwise, it fails.
Why the error occurs:
* No default pull strategy is configured.
* Git refuses to continue without knowing whether to merge, rebase, or fast-forward.
How to resolve (one-time):
git pull --rebase
# or
git pull --no-rebase
# or
git pull --ff-only
How to set a default (recommended):
git config --global pull.rebase true   # rebase by default
After choosing a strategy, git pull will work normally.
