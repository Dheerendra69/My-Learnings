index() is used only to speed up reads, not for correctness.
In your table, indexes are added on columns that are frequently used in WHERE / JOIN / ORDER / FILTER conditions.
Why each indexed column makes sense
is_mobile_verified
* Common filter: verified vs non-verified leads
* Example: WHERE is_mobile_verified = 20
* 
requirement_type
* Used to segment leads (BottomWear / TopWear)
* Helps dashboards & reports
business_nature
* Manufacturer vs Trader filtering
* Often used by sales teams
is_gst_verified
* Compliance / eligibility checks
* Fast filtering for verified GST leads
product_lead_type
* Core business dimension (Cotton, Denim, etc.)
* Almost always used in queries
Indexes make these queries O(log n) instead of full table scans.

When not to add an index
Do not index:
* Free-text fields (name, work_email)
* Columns rarely used in filters
* Columns with extremely low cardinality if table is tiny

Cost of indexes (why not index everything)
* Slower INSERT / UPDATE
* More disk usage
* More maintenance overhead
So indexing is a performance decision, not a schema requirement.

Rule of thumb
Index columns you filter, group, or join on regularly.
Your usage of index() here is correct and practical, not overengineering.
