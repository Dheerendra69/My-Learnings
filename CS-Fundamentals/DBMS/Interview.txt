What are the advantages of using a DBMS?
The advantages of using a DBMS are:

Data Integrity: Ensures that the data is accurate and consistent.
Data Security: Provides controlled access to sensitive data by setting permissions for different users.
Efficient Data Retrieval: Optimizes queries and indexing, allowing faster data retrieval.
Reduced Redundancy: Avoids duplicate data by enforcing normalization.
Backup and Recovery: Offers automatic backup and recovery mechanisms.
Concurrent Access: Allows multiple users to access the database at the same time without conflicts.

What are the different types of DBMS?
The four types of DBMS are:

Hierarchical DBMS: Data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. Example: IBM’s IMS.
Network DBMS: Data is represented as a graph with many-to-many relationships. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).
Relational DBMS (RDBMS): Data is organized in tables (relations) and managed through SQL. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
Object-Oriented DBMS: Data is stored as objects, like in object-oriented programming. Example: ObjectDB.
